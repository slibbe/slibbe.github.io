In the above example, the file would be found at {site root}/static/images/background.png. Optionally set medium_src and small_src to smaller images to use on screens that are at most 1024px and 640px, respectively. If either of these are omitted, the next largest image source will be used. Set fit_width to true if you want the behavior of CSS background-size: contain and false if you want the behavior of background-size: cover  Custom Colors Add the following to your site&amp;rsquo;s config.toml file:[Params.color] page_background = &amp;quot;#000000&amp;quot; main_background = &amp;quot;#050505&amp;quot; alt_background = &amp;quot;#252525&amp;quot; main_text = &amp;quot;#e2e2e2&amp;quot; alt_text = &amp;quot;#e2e2e2&amp;quot; accent = &amp;quot;#2c8cef&amp;quot; accent_text = &amp;quot;#e2e2e2&amp;quot;  The above values represent the default colors in the theme. Modify them as you&amp;rsquo;d like. page_background is the background color for what is &amp;ldquo;behind&amp;rdquo; the page. This is the same area as where the background image is applied, so it is a good idea to pick a color that matches the image if you use fit_width = true on the background image. main_background is the background color for most of the content page. alt_background is the alternate background color for the page. This background is applied to the navigation bar, footer, various buttons, and as the alternate color for zebra-striped tables. main_text is the font color that corresponds with main_background. alt_text is the font color that corresponds with alt_background. accent is the color applied to the site header, links, and buttons that are hovered over or marked active. accent_text is the font color that is used when accent is being used as the background color.  Font Customization BluestNight uses the following font families: Clear Sans (sans-serif) Zilla Slab (serif) Source Code Pro (monospace)  By default, Clear Sans is used for all text on the on the web page except for &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; blocks, which use Source Code Pro, and any text inside of the handwriting shortcode. Zilla Slab is used by default for text when a page is printed.These defaults can be modified, though, through the use of four configuration properties and two shortcodes.[Params.fonts] header_style = &amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot; body_style = &amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot; print_header_style = &amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot; print_body_style = &amp;quot;serif&amp;quot;  The above code block shows the default values of each of the four configuration properties and how they would appear inside on a configuration file written in TOML. Properties prefixed with print_ affect printed pages only, while those without affect only the page on a screen. The header_style properties set the font family for all page headers, while the body_style ones affect the main text of the page (inside the &amp;lt;article&amp;gt; tag, for the web developers).If header_style and body_style (or print_header_style and print_body_style) match, the choice of &amp;ldquo;serif&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;sans-serif&amp;rdquo; is applied to the entire page. If they do not match, text in the footer and sidebar is ignored, unless it is a header. If you want to change the font family for a block of text on a page, you can use the {{% serif %}} and {{% sans-serif %}} shortcodes.Examples {{% serif %}} This text will **always** be *serif*. {{% /serif %}}  This text will always be serif.  {{% sans-serif %}} This text will **always** be *sans-serif*. {{% /sans-serif %}}  This text will always be sans-serif.

Set hide_list to true in the front matter of the _index.md file and BluestNight will only generate the custom content on that page.Show nested sections Sections onlyIf you want to display the nested sections under the one a list page represents, set list_subsections to true in the page&amp;rsquo;s front matter. The list will not be displayed if hide_list is set to true.Sort/filter listed pages By default, BluestNight (and Hugo) sort the pages under a section or taxonomy by date, with the newest page first. You have the ability to choose what page field to sort by and in ascending or descending order. You also have the ability to filter only pages with the file name index.md.Custom sort field To sort the entries in the list, set the values of sort_field and (optionally) sort_order in the list page&amp;rsquo;s front matter. Valid values for sort_field are any ordering page variable without the leading By OR any front matter variable with the prefix Params. If the template sorting method you want to use in the Hugo docs is ByDate, sort_field should be &amp;quot;Date&amp;quot;. If sorting by the custom front matter parameter sorting_weight, sort_field should be &amp;quot;Params.sorting_weight&amp;quot; (note the lack of a leading . on Params).  Custom sort order Valid values for sort_order are &amp;quot;asc&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;desc&amp;quot;. If sort_order is not specified, the order will depend on what makes the most sense for that field. sort_order is ignored if sort_field is not specified. Date fields are descending (new first) by default. Title and Weight fields are ascending (A-Z and 1-9) by default. Sort fields beginning with Params are also ascending by default and cannot currently be changed.  To sort the pages in a custom order, you can set a variable in the front matter, for example sort_weight, and number the pages in the order you want them to appear in.+++ # file name: _index.md title = &amp;quot;List page&amp;quot; sort_field = &amp;quot;Params.sort_weight&amp;quot; +++ +++ # file name: first.md title = &amp;quot;First article&amp;quot; sort_weight = 1 +++ +++ # file name: second.md title = &amp;quot;Second article&amp;quot; sort_weight = 2 +++  Filter only index.md To display only those pages with the file name index.md, set index_only to true in the list page&amp;rsquo;s front matter.

Using {{% shortcode %}} instead will cause the form to render incorrectly. netlify-form The netlify-form shortcode serves as a wrapper to the rest of the shortcodes on this page. Without it you may be able to use the other shortcodes to make form elements, but they won&amp;rsquo;t submit anywhere. The other shortcodes are designed to be used as inner content to netlify-form.Required Parameters: name: Equivalent to the name attribute on an HTML &amp;lt;form&amp;gt;. Must be unique among forms on the page.  Optional Parameters: action: The page to take the user to after they submit the form. Ideally should thank them for their submission. Defaults to a page from Netlify that redirects back to the page they left.  Example &amp;ldquo;Contact&amp;rdquo; form:{{&amp;lt; netlify-form name=&amp;quot;contact&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt; form-input id=&amp;quot;firstname&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; placeholder=&amp;quot;John&amp;quot; label=&amp;quot;First Name:&amp;quot; required=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt; form-input id=&amp;quot;lastname&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; placeholder=&amp;quot;Doe&amp;quot; label=&amp;quot;Last Name:&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt; form-input id=&amp;quot;reply_email&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;email&amp;quot; placeholder=&amp;quot;john.doe@email.com&amp;quot; label=&amp;quot;Reply-To Email:&amp;quot; required=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt; mult-input label=&amp;quot;Gender:&amp;quot; name=&amp;quot;gender&amp;quot; required=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; add_other=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;select&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt; form-option label=&amp;quot;Male&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;male&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt; form-option label=&amp;quot;Female&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;female&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt; /mult-input &amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt; form-input type=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; id=&amp;quot;submit_reason&amp;quot; required=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; label=&amp;quot;Reason for contacting:&amp;quot; placeholder=&amp;quot;Problem with site&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt; form-input id=&amp;quot;contact_description&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;textarea&amp;quot; label=&amp;quot;Explain:&amp;quot; required=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}} {{&amp;lt; /netlify-form &amp;gt;}}  form-input The form-input shortcode is used to create any form input except radio buttons and checkboxes, which are handled by mult-input instead. See here for a list of valid HTML &amp;lt;input&amp;gt; types.BluestNight makes a few changes to the above list of input types for this shortcode. First, textarea is considered a valid input type, equivalent to the HTML &amp;lt;textarea&amp;gt; element, which is a multiline text entry field. Second, all &amp;ldquo;button&amp;rdquo; types are considered invalid, as the form automatically includes buttons to submit and clear the form. These invalid types are: button: A standard button image: A button made from an image submit: Submits the form reset: Clears the form, allowing the user to start over  If you enter an invalid input type, BluestNight will render a small warning where the input element should be.Required parameters: type: A valid input type from the above link. id: A unique identifier for the input field. Must be unique across input elements in all forms on the page. accept: Only for type=&amp;quot;file&amp;quot; inputs. Specify valid file types to submit. See here for what valid values look like.  Optional parameters: placeholder: Placeholder text to appear inside the element as an example of valid input. minlength/maxlength: Set the minimum and/or maximum character length for the input. regex: A regular expression that valid input must match. Use types email, url, date, or time if you want to validate against one of those. value: Set a default value in the input field. Not recommended unless you have good reason. required: &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; if this input field is required. Numeric and Datetime inputs (number, range, date)  min: The minimum value allowed. See more. max: The maximum value allowed. See more. step: If specified, indicates that the value of the input must be equal to min + n * step, where n is an integer. See more.  file and email type inputs  multiple: &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; if more than one file or email address can be entered in this field.   mult-input The mult-input shortcode acts as a wrapper around multiple related radio or checkbox elements.Required parameters: type: radio or select for when only one selection can be made and checkbox for multiple selections. name: A unique identifier for the input field. Must be unique across input elements in all forms on the page. label: A label for the group of radio buttons or checkboxes  Optional parameters: add_other: &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; to add an &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; option to the end of the list with an accompanying textbox below it. required: For radio and select types. &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; if a selection is required.  form-option The form-option shortcode indicates one of a group of related options under a mult-input.Required parameters: label: A label for this particular option. value: The value returned from the form when this option is selected. Is not displayed to the end user.  Optional parameters: selected: &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; for this option to be selected by default. Only add this to one option for radio and select types. required: checkbox only. &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; if this checkbox must be checked before the form is submitted. Do not use to indicate that at least one checkbox must be checked. ",

After &amp;ldquo;table&amp;rdquo; comes a list of column names in the order that they should appear, from left to right. {{&amp;lt; table-row &amp;gt;}} serves as a container for {{% table-row %}} and does not take any parameters. {{% table-row %}} takes content in between the opening and closing tags. There should be a number of {{% table-row %}} tags equal to the number of column names, and values should appear in the same order as their labels do.  Known Limitations  {{&amp;lt; table &amp;gt;}} and {{&amp;lt; table-row &amp;gt;}} must use the {{&amp;lt;&amp;gt;}} syntax for shortcodes. Using {{%%}} will cause the inner HTML to display inside a code block instead or rendering on the page. {{% table-row %}} can use either, though {{%%}} is recommended so you can use markdown inside of the cell. {{% table-cell %}} tags must be on the same line as content, or else an issue occurs similar to the one above. Reference style markdown links cannot be used inside of {{% table-cell %}} tags. Inline link syntax ([link text](url)) works fine. The shortcodes do not support colspan, rowspan, &amp;lt;caption&amp;gt;, or table footers. Then again, neither do markdown tables&amp;hellip;  ",
